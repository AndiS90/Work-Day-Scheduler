# Work-Day-Scheduler


<p> My personal objective in regard to this project was to add functioning javascript to a page with html and css already provided. In this case my goal was to create a simple day planner that would present the current date with a functioning clock and snippets of the page divided into hour long sections with each section capable of storing that days event data in local storage. Each hour-long snippet would also be color coded depending on the present hour.
</p>

<p>
I started by creating variables holding the hour snippet elements of the html page and storing them in an array. Moment.js was then used in a setInterval function to present the time, and later in a for loop to add different css classes based on passing time. Finally, a small series of loops was added to integrate local storage.

<p>
 The time spent on the project helped me obtain a level of comfort with using moment.js and reinforced my concepts regarding local storage
